pilot
=====

An open source website for musicians to sell their music free from the clasps of record labels and distribution companies.

Pilot is a new way to sell music online. Too long have musicians been robbed by labels or expensive distribution companies. These corporations feed off successfull musicans, often returning only a fraction of sales to the individual. For musicians who produce and distribute their own music, they should also be granted freedom in their sales. Pilot is an open source project that will give musicians back that freedom.
